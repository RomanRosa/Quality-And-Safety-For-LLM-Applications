## Skills and Experience Gained in Security Measures for LLM Applications

### Monitoring and Enhancing Security Measures

- 🔒 **Monitored and Enhanced Security Measures**: I actively monitored and enhanced security measures over time to safeguard my Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

### Detecting and Preventing Security Threats

- 🚨 **Detected and Prevented Critical Security Threats**: Learned to detect and prevent critical security threats such as hallucinations, jailbreaks, and data leakage in LLM applications.

### Exploring Real-World Scenarios

- 🌍 **Explored Real-World Scenarios for Risk Preparation**: Gained insights into real-world scenarios to prepare for potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with LLM applications.

## Insights from the Course on Safety and Quality in LLM Applications

### Addressing Safety and Quality in LLM Applications

In this course, I explored new metrics and best practices to monitor my Large Language Model (LLM) systems, ensuring safety and quality. Building LLM applications presented unique challenges, which the course helped me to navigate effectively.

### Skills and Techniques Acquired

- 🕵️ **Identified Hallucinations with SelfCheckGPT**: Learned methods like SelfCheckGPT to identify hallucinations in LLM responses.

- 🔒 **Detected Jailbreaks Using Sentiment Analysis**: Acquired skills to detect jailbreaks (prompts that attempt to manipulate LLM responses) using sentiment analysis and implicit toxicity detection models.

- 📊 **Identified Data Leakage**: Mastered the use of entity recognition and vector similarity analysis to identify data leakage.

- 🛠️ **Built a Monitoring System for App Safety and Security**: Developed my own system to evaluate and monitor the safety and security of LLM applications over time.

### Course Completion and Customization Skills

- 🎓 **Gained Ability to Identify Security Concerns in LLM-Based Applications**: Upon completing the course, I developed the ability to identify common security concerns in LLM-based applications and learned to customize safety and security evaluation tools to the specific LLM used in my application.
